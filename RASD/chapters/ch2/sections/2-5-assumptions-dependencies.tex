\section{Assumptions and dependencies}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Every car is equipped with a sensor that communicates to the system if the car's engine is running or not. The value of this sensor is ON for the former case, OFF for the latter.
	\item Every car is equipped with an onboard computer.
	\item Every car is equipped with a GPS receiver that communicates the car location to the system. The data transmitted to the system corresponds to the geographic coordinates of the car location.
	\item The car's seats are equipped with a sensor able to detect the presence of a person seated in the car. The signal transmitted to the system is equal to 1 if a person is detected, 0 (zero) otherwise.
	\item The car can inform the system whether the doors are closed or not. If at least one of the door is open, the value transimitted is equal to 0 (zero), 1 otherwise.
	\item The set of safe areas is defined by the system administrator.
	\item The car can inform the system about the battery level. The value transmitted is equal to the percentage of the battery charge available. Moreover, the car communicates to the system whether the battery is charging or not.
